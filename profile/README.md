🙋‍ Okwetcha significa DAR/DOAR , a ideia é criar uma comunidade que com auxilio </br>
da Engenharia ajude de algum modo países africanos ou comunidades africanas a resolverem alguns problemas. 🌈

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
